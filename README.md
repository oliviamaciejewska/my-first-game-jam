# My First Game Jam
Game submission for My First Game Jam Summer 2020

https://moopmoopmoop.itch.io/diaperchange

## Premise of Game
The theme of the game jam is **Change**. We decided to take the simple meaning of change, and create a game where a mother chases her baby trying to change his diaper.

Inspired by the chase style of Crash Bandicoot or Castle Crashers mini game, the mother chases the baby whilist you (the baby) run away from her by doging obstacles that come in your way.

## Controls
'W' - Up

'S' - Down

'Space' - Dodge
